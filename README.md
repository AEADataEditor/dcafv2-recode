# Recoding old into new DCAF

## Old DCAF (active until February 2024, but leakage)

This form had three values:

- data that can be made available to the Data Editor (privately).
- data that cannot be provided, but can be obtained by replicators within a short time frame.
- data that cannot be easily accessed.

They are not mutually exclusive, but are also not well defined.

## New DCAF

The new [DCAF](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/forms/data-code-availability) is a bit clearer, and more explicit:

- Very Easy to Obtain (example: request takes just a few minutes with no associated costs and the expected response is within a few days).
- Moderately Easy to Obtain (example: request takes less than an hour with minimal cost).
- Moderately Difficult to Obtain (examples: request requires a multipage application; request needs university approvals; request involves significant cost; there is some uncertainty as to whether the proposal will be granted).
- Very Difficult to Obtain (examples: request must be made in person and/or access is provided only in person; request requires substantial funding; data and/or access mechanism may no longer exist).

Some additional examples:

- Very Easy to Obtain:
  - This would include [IPUMS](https://www.ipums.org), which requires some user sign up and use agreements, even for 100% files and most international censuses, but generally *access* is fast (data extraction itself might still take time);
  - [WVS](https://worldvalues.org), which has a four-item click-through license which just needs to be filled out
- Moderately Easy to Obtain:
  - [DHS](https://dhsprogram.com), where a "real" application must be written, which is read by a human being, but otherwise is relatively fast; but see below for DHS geocodes.
  - GSOEP, but only for EU nationals
- Moderately Difficult to Obtain (examples: request requires a multipage application; request needs university approvals; request involves significant cost; there is some uncertainty as to whether the proposal will be granted).
  - Some IPUMS International censuses, which require approval by the partner institution, and might take time
  - DHS geocodes in cases where the partner institution needs to give approval
  - but also FSRDC, Canadian RDCN, IAB, CASD: any of the formal research data centers, even from the perspective of a local person
  - may also include GSOEP if the requester is abroad, and needs to sign an institutional agreement
  - various corporate subscriptions, including WRDS, which cannot be obtained without a lot of lawyers interacting, but do have a formal access mechanism

- Very Difficult to Obtain
  - Individual data use agreements that rely on personal interactions
  - Data that are only available in a single physical location in person
